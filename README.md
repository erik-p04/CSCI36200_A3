The user will run the makefile to start the program. They are then prompted to enter the size of the nxn board, this integer must be greater than 3 but there is no limit. The program will then start to put queens on the board, the user will be shown the board everytime a queen is added or edited. The program will run until all queens are placed without any conflicts. If the queens cannot all be placed on board, the program will output a message saying there is not solution.
